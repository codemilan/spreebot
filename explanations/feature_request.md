Weâ€™re interested in hearing your ideas for new features, but creating feature requests in the Issue Tracker is not the proper way to ask for a feature. A feature request is any idea you have to improve the software experience that is not strictly related to a bug or error of omission.

Feature requests without accompanying code will be closed immediately. We simply cannot respond efficiently to feature requests through our Issue Tracker. If you want to suggest a feature, please use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spree-user).

DON'T get discouraged if your issue is closed, Spree is a busy project and is getting lots of issues so we need your help make sure every issue contains everything needed. See our [contributing guidelines](http://dev.spreecommerce.com/contributing/) for more information.
